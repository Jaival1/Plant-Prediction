# Plant-Prediction
A machine learning-based approach that identifies the crops and crop diseases.
Developed a predictive solution for distinguishing between healthy and diseased states of plant leaves based on image datasets. This solution should accurately predict the presence of diseases upon scanning the images of plant leaves providing relevant pesticides to cure it.
Plant images are identified, and the disease is predicted by employing a variety of models with different optimizers. The results are then visualized, emphasizing the models that demonstrate the highest accuracy.

Dataset:  New Plant Disease 
Consists of 87K RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves
Categorized into 38 different classes and 14 different plants
Divided into 80:20 ratio of traning and validation data
